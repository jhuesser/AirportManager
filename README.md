# AirportManager
This is a console application written in swift. It was created to learn swift, especially directories and functions. It's inspired from the tutorials on sololearn.com

# Usage
At the beginning the application asks you for an option. l = lookup an airport code (e.g. LHR => London Heathrow), a = adding an airport (e.g. add ZRH => Zurich Airport), d for deleting an airport by code (e.g. delete GVA => Geneve) and q for quit.

# ToDo
Comment the code
